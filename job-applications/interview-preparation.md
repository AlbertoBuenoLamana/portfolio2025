## üìã Technical Interview Preparation

### Angular Deep Dive

#### Angular 19 Specific Features (Your Advantage)
```typescript
// Standalone components (Angular 14+, perfected in 19)
@Component({
  selector: 'app-user',
  standalone: true,
  imports: [CommonModule, FormsModule],
  template: `<div>{{user.name}}</div>`
})
export class UserComponent { }

// Signal-based state management (Angular 16+)
export class UserService {
  users = signal<User[]>([]);
  
  addUser(user: User) {
    this.users.update(users => [...users, user]);
  }
}

// Control flow syntax (Angular 17+)
@if (user) {
  <div>{{user.name}}</div>
} @else {
  <div>Loading...</div>
}
```

#### Migration Expertise (Your Specialty)
**Common Questions:**
- "How did you approach the AngularJS to Angular migration?"
- "What challenges did you face during the Polymer to Angular migration?"
- "How do you ensure compatibility during incremental migrations?"

**Your Answers:**
```
For the Morabanc AngularJS to Angular 13 migration:
1. Created a hybrid application using ngUpgrade
2. Implemented component-by-component migration strategy
3. Established comprehensive testing for both old and new components
4. Used feature flags to enable gradual rollout
5. Maintained backward compatibility throughout the process
6. Achieved 40% performance improvement post-migration
```

#### Performance Optimization
**Topics to Cover:**
- OnPush change detection strategy
- Lazy loading modules and components
- Bundle size optimization with webpack
- Angular Universal for SSR
- Service worker implementation

**Example Answer:**
```typescript
// OnPush optimization example
@Component({
  changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush,
  template: `...`
})
export class OptimizedComponent {
  @Input() data: Data;
  
  constructor(private cdr: ChangeDetectorRef) {}
  
  updateData(newData: Data) {
    this.data = newData;
    this.cdr.markForCheck(); // Manual change detection
  }
}
```

### RxJS & Reactive Programming

#### Essential Operators
```typescript
// Combination operators
const userWithProfile$ = this.user$.pipe(
  switchMap(user => this.profileService.getProfile(user.id)),
  catchError(error => of(null))
);

// Error handling patterns
const dataStream$ = this.apiService.getData().pipe(
  retry(3),
  catchError(error => {
    this.errorHandler.handle(error);
    return throwError(error);
  })
);

// Memory leak prevention
ngOnDestroy() {
  this.subscription$.unsubscribe();
  // Or use takeUntil pattern
  this.dataStream$.pipe(
    takeUntil(this.destroy$)
  ).subscribe();
}
```

#### Common RxJS Questions
1. **"Difference between switchMap, mergeMap, concatMap?"**
   - switchMap: Cancels previous, good for search
   - mergeMap: Runs concurrent, good for independent operations
   - concatMap: Sequential execution, good for order-dependent operations

2. **"How do you handle memory leaks in Angular?"**
   - Unsubscribe in ngOnDestroy
   - Use async pipe in templates
   - takeUntil pattern with destroy subject

### Testing Knowledge (Based on your testing guide)

#### Unit Testing Examples
```typescript
describe('UserComponent', () => {
  let component: UserComponent;
  let fixture: ComponentFixture<UserComponent>;
  let userService: jasmine.SpyObj<UserService>;

  beforeEach(() => {
    const spy = jasmine.createSpyObj('UserService', ['getUsers']);
    
    TestBed.configureTestingModule({
      declarations: [UserComponent],
      providers: [{ provide: UserService, useValue: spy }]
    });
    
    fixture = TestBed.createComponent(UserComponent);
    component = fixture.componentInstance;
    userService = TestBed.inject(UserService) as jasmine.SpyObj<UserService>;
  });

  it('should load users on init', () => {
    const mockUsers = [{ id: 1, name: 'Test' }];
    userService.getUsers.and.returnValue(of(mockUsers));
    
    component.ngOnInit();
    
    expect(component.users).toEqual(mockUsers);
  });
});
```

### System Design Questions

#### Frontend Architecture
```
API Layer
‚Üì
State Management (NgRx/Services)
‚Üì
Smart Components (Containers)
‚Üì
Dumb Components (Presentational)
‚Üì
UI Library (Material/Custom)
```

#### Scalability Patterns
- Lazy loading modules
- Micro-frontend architecture
- Component libraries
- State management strategies
- Caching strategies

### Common Behavioral Questions & Answers

#### "Why do you want to work here?"
**Framework**: Research + Alignment + Enthusiasm

**For Consulting (Everis, Indra):**
"I'm excited about [Company] because of your reputation for digital transformation projects. Having led complex migrations myself, I understand the challenges organizations face modernizing legacy systems. Your focus on [specific company strength] aligns with my experience in [relevant experience], and I'm eager to apply my Angular expertise to help diverse clients achieve their technology goals."

**For Product Companies (AWS, Workato):**
"I'm passionate about [Company] because you're building products that directly enable other organizations to innovate. My AWS certification gives me deep appreciation for how your services empower businesses. The opportunity to work on [specific product] that impacts [specific user base] aligns perfectly with my goal of creating technology that makes a meaningful difference at scale."

**For Local Companies (Tecnalia, Grupo Ses√©):**
"I'm excited about [Company] because of your significant impact on the Arag√≥n region and your commitment to innovation. Having built my career in Zaragoza, I want to contribute to companies that are advancing our local technology ecosystem. Your work in [specific area] represents exactly the kind of meaningful, local impact I want to be part of."

#### "What's your biggest weakness?"
**Framework**: Real weakness + Improvement actions + Progress made

"Earlier in my career, I focused heavily on technical implementation without always considering the broader business impact. I realized this when working on the banking project‚Äîwhile my code was technically sound, I wasn't always translating technical decisions into business value for stakeholders.

To address this, I started attending business requirements meetings and asking questions about user impact. I also began documenting technical decisions in terms of business benefits. Now, when I propose technical solutions, I always include the business justification and expected user impact. This approach helped significantly during the CLUN API project, where I could clearly communicate technical trade-offs to non-technical stakeholders."

#### "Where do you see yourself in 5 years?"
**Framework**: Growth trajectory + Company alignment + Mutual benefit

"In five years, I see myself as a technical leader who bridges the gap between cutting-edge frontend development and business strategy. I want to continue growing my expertise in Angular and cloud architectures while developing skills in system design and technical leadership.

Specifically, I'd like to be leading migration projects and mentoring teams through complex technical transformations‚Äîsimilar to what I've done, but at larger scale. I'm also interested in the intersection of AI-assisted development and traditional software engineering, which I believe will transform how we build applications.

At [Company], I see this path aligning with [specific growth opportunity at company], and I believe my experience with migrations and team leadership would enable me to contribute to [company-specific strategic goal]."
